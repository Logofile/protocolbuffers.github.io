Protobuf language bindings have two components. The generated code (typically
produced from `protoc`) and the runtime libraries that must be included when
using the generated code. When these come from different releases of protobuf,
we are in a "cross version runtime" situation.

We intend to offer the following guarantees across most languages. These are the
default guarantees; however, owners of protobuf code generators and runtimes may
explicitly override them with more specific guarantees for that language.
[C++ and Rust](#cpp) have stricter guarantees than typical, and
[Python](#python) has looser ones.

Protobuf cross-version usages outside the guarantees are **error-prone and not
supported**. Version skews can lead to *flakes and undefined behaviors* that are
hard to diagnose, even if it can often *seem* to work as long as nothing has
changed in a source-incompatible way. For Protobuf, the proliferation of tools
and services that rely on using unsupported Protobuf language bindings prevents
the protobuf team from updating the protobuf implementation in response to bug
reports or security vulnerabilities.

## New Gencode + Old Runtime = Never Allowed {#backwards}

We may add new runtime APIs in any kind of release (Major, Minor, or Patch).
Gencode in that release is allowed to use those new APIs. The consequence is
that gencode should never be paired with a runtime that predates the `protoc`
and plugin that was used to generate those bindings.

We will add “poison pills” where possible to prevent attempts to pair newer
gencode with an older runtime.

## Major Versions {#major}

Starting with the 2025Q1 release, the protobuf project will adopt a rolling
compatibility window for major versions. Code generated for a major version V
(full version: V.x.y) will be supported by protobuf runtimes of version V and
V+1.

Prior to this policy, code generated for 3.22.x+ (release ~1 year prior to major
version 4) will still be supported by protobuf runtimes of version 3 and 4.
Users with older gencode should upgrade to the latest gencode from 3.25.x.

Protobuf will not support using gencode from version V with runtime &gt;= V+2
and will be using a "poison pill" mechanism to fail with a clear error message
when a software assembly attempts to use such a configuration.

**Note:** [C++ and Rust](#cpp) do not support compatibility windows, and
[Python](#python) supports much longer ones.

## Minor Versions {#minor}

Within a single major runtime version, generated code from an older version of
`protoc` will run on a newer runtime.

**Note:** [C++ and Rust](#cpp) do not support compatibility across minor
versions.

## Security Exception {#exception}

We reserve the right to violate the above promises if needed for security
reasons. We expect these exceptions to be rare, but will always prioritize
security above these guarantees. For example,
[footmitten](https://cve.report/CVE-2022-3510) required paired updates to both
the runtime and the generated code for Java. As a result, code generated by
3.20.3 (which contained the footmitten fix) would not load with runtime library
3.21.6 (which predates the footmitten fix), creating the following compatibility
matrix:

*   “Vuln” indicates that the combination will successfully start, but the
    security vulnerability still exists.
*   “Works” indicates that the combination will successfully start and does not
    have the vulnerability.
*   “Broken” indicates that the combination will not successfully start.
*   **Bold** indicates configurations that were never deliberately intended to
    function together given the guarantees outlined in this topic.

## No Coexistence of Multiple Major Runtime Versions {#coexist}

Coexistence of multiple major versions in the same process is **not** supported.

## C++ and Rust-specific Guarantees {#cpp}

Protobuf C++ and Rust disclaim all cross-runtime support and require an exact
match between the generated code version and the runtime version at all times.

Additionally, Protobuf C++ makes no guarantees about ABI stability across any
releases (major, minor, or micro).

## Python-specific Guarantees {#python}

Since the 3.20.0 release, the Protobuf Python generated code became a thin
wrapper around an embedded `FileDescriptorProto`. Because these protos are
supported on extremely long timeframes, our usual
[major version compatibility windows](#major) aren't typically necessary.

Python may break generated code compatibility in specific future major version
releases, but it will be coupled with poison pill warnings and errors in
advance. As of 6.32.0, all generated code since 3.20.0 will be supported until
at least 8.x.y.
