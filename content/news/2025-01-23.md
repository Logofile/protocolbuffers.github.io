## Poison Java gencode

We are patching a change into the 25.x branch that will poison Java gencode that
was created prior to the
[3.21.7 release](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v21.7).
We will then mark all versions of Java protobuf from 3.21.7 through 3.25.5 as
vulnerable to the
[footmitten CVE](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2).

After this change is patched in, protobuf will throw an
`UnsupportedOperationException` from the
[`makeExtensionsImmutable`](https://protobuf.dev/reference/java/api-docs/com/google/protobuf/GeneratedMessage.html#makeExtensionsImmutable\(\))
method unless you set the system property
"`-Dcom.google.protobuf.use_unsafe_pre22_gencode`". Using this system property
can buy you some time if you can't update your code immediately, but should be
considered a short-term workaround.

## Poison MSVC + Bazel

We will be dropping support for using Bazel and MSVC together in v34. As of v30,
we will poison this combination with an error unless you specify the opt-out
flag `--define=protobuf_allow_msvc=true` to silence it.

MSVC's path length limits combined with Bazel's sandboxing have become
increasingly difficult to support in combination. Rather than randomly break
users who install protobuf into a long path, we will prohibit the use of MSVC
from Bazel altogether. We will continue to support MSVC with CMake, and begin
supporting [clang-cl](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#clang-cl)
with Bazel. For any feedback or discussion, see
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/20085.
