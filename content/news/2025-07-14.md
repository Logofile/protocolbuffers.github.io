## Deprecating FieldDescriptor Enums

We are announcing an upcoming change regarding the `FieldDescriptor` enum and
its associated values representing optional, required, and repeated. These are
being deprecated as we encourage the use of more precise accessor methods.

### Background

While at one time the `FieldDescriptor.label` enum served a purpose, the
evolution of Protocol Buffers has introduced more idiomatic ways to determine a
field's cardinality (singular/repeated) and presence semantics.

*   In proto2, `optional`, `required`, and `repeated` are explicit keywords.
*   In proto3, `required` is no longer supported. All scalar fields are
    implicitly "`optional`" in the sense that they have default values if not
    set. The `optional` keyword was later reintroduced in proto3 to explicitly
    track presence for scalar fields (distinguishing between an unset field and
    a field set to its default value).
*   In edition 2023 we removed the `optional` and `required` keywords and use
    features to control those behaviors.

The `label` enum conflates these distinct concepts (cardinality, requiredness,
and explicit presence tracking), leading to potential confusion, especially with
proto3's field presence model.

### Impact and Migration

The `FieldDescriptor.label` field will eventually be removed from the API.

Note that the method names in this topic may be spelled slightly differently in
some languages.

*   **For Protocol Buffer Editions fields:**
    *   **Key Methods for Editions:**
        *   `hasPresence` becomes the primary method to determine if a singular
            field tracks presence, reflecting the
            [`features.field_presence`](/editions/features#field_presence)
            setting for that field.
    *   **Migration:** Rely on `isRepeated` and `isRequired` for cardinality and
        `hasPresence` to check for explicit presence tracking in singular
        fields.
*   **For proto2/proto3 fields:** `getLabel` will eventually be removed, and is
    not recommended in the meantime.

All users of Protocol Buffers who interact with `FieldDescriptor` objects in
their code (for example for code generation, reflection, and dynamic message
handling) should migrate away from using `FieldDescriptor.label` directly.

Instead, update your code to use the following methods:

*   To check if a field is repeated: `field.isRepeated`
*   To check if a field is required (proto2 and editions only):
    `field.isRequired`
*   To check if a singular field has explicit presence, use `hasPresence`

### Timeline

This deprecation is effective immediately. While `getLabel` will continue to
function, we recommend migrating your code proactively to ensure future
compatibility and clarity. This change will lead to a more robust and
understandable experience for developers using Protocol Buffers.
