We are planning to modify the Protobuf debug APIs (including Protobuf
AbslStringify, `proto2::ShortFormat`, `proto2::Utf8Format`,
`Message::DebugString`, `Message::ShortDebugString`, `Message::Utf8DebugString`)
in v30 to redact sensitive fields annotated by `debug_redact`; the outputs of
these APIs will contain a per-process randomized prefix, and so will no longer
be parseable by Protobuf TextFormat Parsers.

## Motivation

Currently Protobuf debug APIs print every field in a proto into human-readable
formats. This may lead to privacy incidents where developers accidentally log
Protobuf debug outputs containing sensitive fields.

## How to Annotate Sensitive Fields

There are two ways to mark fields sensitive:

*   Mark a field with the field option `debug_redact = true`, directly.

    ```proto
    message Foo {
      optional string secret = 1 [debug_redact = true];
    }
    ```

*   If you have already defined a field annotation of type Enum by extending
    `proto2.FieldOptions`, and certain values of this annotation are used to
    annotate fields you would like to redact, then you can annotate these values
    with `debug_redact = true`. All the fields that have been annotated with
    such values will be redacted.

    ```proto
    package my.package;

    extend proto2.FieldOptions {
      # The existing field annotation
      optional ContentType content_type = 1234567;
    };

    enum ContentType {
      PUBLIC = 0;
      SECRET = 1 [debug_redact = true];
    };

    message Foo {
      # will not be redacted
      optional string public_info = 1 [
        (my.package.content_type) = PUBLIC
      ];
      # will be redacted
      optional string secret = 1 [
        (my.package.content_type) = SECRET
      ];
    }
    ```

## New Debug Format

Compared to the existing debug format, the new debug format has two major
differences:

*   The sensitive fields annotated with `debug_redact` are redacted
    automatically in the output formats
*   The output formats will contain a per-process randomized prefix, which will
    make them no longer be parsable by TextFormat parsers.

Note that the second change is true regardless of whether the proto contains
sensitive fields or not, which ensures that any debug output always cannot be
deserialized regardless of the proto content.
