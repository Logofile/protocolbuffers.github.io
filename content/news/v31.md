The following announcements are specific to Version 31.x, which was released May
14, 2025. For information presented chronologically, see
[News](/news).

The following sections cover planned breaking changes in the v31 release,
expected in 2025 Q2. Also included are some changes that aren't breaking but may
require action on your part. These describe changes as we anticipate them being
implemented, but due to the flexible nature of software some of these changes
may not land or may vary from how they are described in this topic.

## Dropping Ruby 3.0 Support

As per our official
[Ruby support policy](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/getting-started/supported-ruby-versions),
we will be dropping support for Ruby 3.0. The minimum supported Ruby version
will be 3.1.

## Deprecating Label Enums

We are announcing an upcoming change regarding the `FieldDescriptor.label` enum
and its associated values: `FieldDescriptor.LABEL_OPTIONAL`,
`FieldDescriptor.LABEL_REQUIRED`, and `FieldDescriptor.LABEL_REPEATED`. These
are being deprecated as we encourage the use of more precise accessor methods.

### Background

While at one time the `FieldDescriptor.label` enum served a purpose, the
evolution of Protocol Buffers has introduced more explicit ways to determine a
field's cardinality (singular/repeated) and presence semantics.

*   In proto2, `optional`, `required`, and `repeated` are explicit keywords.
*   In proto3, `required` is no longer supported. All scalar fields are
    implicitly "`optional`" in the sense that they have default values if not
    set. The `optional` keyword was later reintroduced in proto3 to explicitly
    track presence for scalar fields (distinguishing between an unset field and
    a field set to its default value).
*   In edition 2023 we removed the `optional` and `required` keywords and use
    features to control those behaviors.

The `label` enum conflates these distinct concepts (cardinality, requiredness,
and explicit presence tracking), leading to potential confusion, especially with
proto3's field presence model.

### Impact and Migration

The `FieldDescriptor.label` field will eventually be removed from the API to
maintain backward compatibility. Note that the method names in this topic may be
spelled slightly differently in some languages.

*   **For Protocol Buffer Editions fields:**
    *   **Behavior:** The `getLabel` method will be simplified:
        *   It will return `FieldDescriptor.LABEL_OPTIONAL` for all singular
            fields.
        *   It will return `FieldDescriptor.LABEL_REPEATED` for all repeated
            fields.
    *   **Key Methods for Editions:**
        *   `hasOptionalKeyword` will always return `false` (as the optional
            keyword's role in presence is superseded by feature-based presence
            in Editions).
        *   `hasPresence` becomes the primary method to determine if a singular
            field tracks presence, reflecting the
            [`features.field_presence`](/editions/features#field_presence)
            setting for that field.
    *   **Migration:** Rely on `isRepeated` for cardinality and `hasPresence` to
        check for explicit presence tracking in singular fields.
*   **For proto3 fields:** `getLabel` will eventually be removed, and is not
    recommended in the meantime. Update your code to use `hasOptionalKeyword`
    and `getRealContainingOneof` instead.
*   **For proto2 fields:** `getLabel` will continue to reflect `LABEL_OPTIONAL`,
    `LABEL_REQUIRED`, or `LABEL_REPEATED` as defined in the .proto file for the
    time being.

All users of Protocol Buffers who interact with `FieldDescriptor` objects in
their code (for example for code generation, reflection, and dynamic message
handling) should migrate away from using `FieldDescriptor.label` directly.

Instead, update your code to use the following methods:

*   To check if a field is repeated: `field.isRepeated`
*   To check if a field is required (proto2 and editions only):
    `field.isRequired`
*   To check if a singular proto3 field has explicit presence, use `hasPresence`
*   To check if a singular field has explicit presence via a oneof, use
    `hasPresence`

### Timeline

This deprecation is effective immediately. While `getLabel` will continue to
function, we recommend migrating your code proactively to ensure future
compatibility and clarity. This change will lead to a more robust and
understandable experience for developers using Protocol Buffers.
