## Go Protobuf: The new Opaque API

Back in March 2020, we released the `google.golang.org/protobuf` module,
[a major overhaul of the Go Protobuf API](https://go.dev/blog/protobuf-apiv2).
This package introduced first-class
[support for reflection](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect),
a [`dynamicpb`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/types/dynamicpb)
implementation and the
[`protocmp`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/testing/protocmp)
package for easier testing.

That release introduced a new protobuf module with a new API. Today, we are
releasing an additional API for generated code, meaning the Go code in the
`.pb.go` files created by the protocol compiler (`protoc`). The blog post at
https://go.dev/blog/protobuf-opaque explains our motivation for creating a new
API and shows you how to use it in your projects.

To be clear: We are not removing anything. We will continue to support the
existing API for generated code, just like we still support the older protobuf
module (by wrapping the `google.golang.org/protobuf` implementation). Go is
[committed to backwards compatibility](https://go.dev/blog/compat) and this
applies to Go Protobuf, too!
