## Retaining support for Bazel with MSVC

We announced on January 23, 2025 that we were planning to drop support for using
Bazel and MSVC together starting in v34. This plan is canceled due to Bazel's
[upcoming changes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26532) to virtual
includes on Windows. Clang-cl support will be kept in place as an alternative on
Windows. The opt-out flag `--define=protobuf_allow_msvc=true` will no longer be
required as of the 32.0 release.
