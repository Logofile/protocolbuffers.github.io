## Stricter validation for `json_name` {#json-name}

v24 will forbid zero unicode code points (`\u0000`) in the
[`json_name` field option](/programming-guides/proto3/#json).
Going forward, any valid Unicode characters will be accepted in `json_name`,
**except** `\u0000`. `\0` characters will still be allowed to be used as values.

Previously, the proto compiler allowed `\0` characters in the `json_name` field
option, but support for this was inconsistent across languages and
implementations. To help prevent interoperability problems relating to
mishandling of keys containing a `\0` character, we are clarifying the spec to
say that `\0` is not allowed in `json_name`, and will be rejected by the
compiler.
